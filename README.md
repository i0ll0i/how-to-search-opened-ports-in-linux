# How to search opened ports in Linux
Opening ports on a system is necessary for various reasons, primarily related to enabling communication between different devices and services over a network. For example, ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) need to be open for web servers like Apache or Nginx to accept incoming requests, ports like 25 (SMTP), 110 (POP3), and 143 (IMAP) need to be open for email servers to send and receive emails, ports 20 and 21 need to be open for FTP servers to transfer files etc.

Opening ports facilitates communication and functionality of services but must be done with careful consideration of security risks and requirements. While opening ports is necessary for various services to function, itâ€™s also important to be aware of the security implications.

There are several ways to detect open ports on Linux.

## Using netstat
netstat is a command-line tool that provides information about network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships. First install netstat (if not already installed):
```
sudo apt-get install net-tools
```
Check open ports:
```
sudo netstat -tuln
```
In this case, the following options are used:

- -t: show TCP ports;
- -u: show UDP ports;
- -l: show only listening ports;
- -n: show numerical addresses instead of resolving hosts.
